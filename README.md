# Azure-Metrics-Downloader-PowerShell
Azure Resources Metrics are generated automatically and for free stored for 30-90 days. Using this small PowerShell script, you can download all metrics for specified resource and store it in CSV. Later you can add the CSV to Storage Account or to One Drive and analyze it using Excel or Power BI. Metrics can be processor, disk utilization etc.

## Stright Scope
If you prefer to using SDK and only stright scope e.g specific Metric and Agregation please check: https://github.com/MariuszFerdyn/Azure-Metrics-Downloader/
